Radar Data Synthesis
This repository contains code and resources for the Radar Data Synthesis project, which utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthesizing radar data. The project includes training data, results, and related resources.
Project Structure

report_images/: This folder contains images showing the accuracy of the model with each parameter.
radar.csv: The CSV file used for training the GAN model.
synthetic.csv: The CSV file showing the results of the synthesized radar data.
GAN_paper.pdf: The seminal GAN paper by Ian Goodfellow.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radar-data-synthesis.git
cd radar-data-synthesis

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage

Training the Model:

Place radar.csv in the root directory.
Run the Jupyter notebook:
shCopyjupyter notebook radar_synthesis.ipynb

The results will be saved in synthetic.csv.



Results and Evaluation

Accuracy images for each parameter are located in the report_images/ folder.
Compare the synthetic data (synthetic.csv) with the original training data (radar.csv) to evaluate the model's performance.
